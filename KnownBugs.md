# Bugs

## Unresolved bugs:

- Song latency, lags and breaks. (Must be from the lavalink, hosting in a NA server should fix this temp. But for permanent fix, Lavalink should be hosted on own.)

- Songs cannot be played using the song name, url needed to given in order to play the song. (This issue is should be from the magmastream package.)
