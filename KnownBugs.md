# Bugs

## Unresolved bugs:

- Song latency, lags and breaks. Even more after magmasteam package update. (Must be from the lavalink, hosting in a NA server should fix this temp. But for permanent fix, Lavalink should be hosted on own.)

## Resolved Bugs:

- Songs cannot be played using the song name, url needed to given in order to play the song. (This issue is should be from the magmastream package.) || Resolved after updated magamastream package.
